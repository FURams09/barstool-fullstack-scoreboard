## Greg Padin's Barstool Sports Full Stack Application Project

Thank you for considering my submission to Barstool's [Full Stack Developer](https://www.barstoolsports.com/jobs/P_AAAAAADAAAgGURjfvKuElq) Position. I really enjoyed working on
this project and hope to have the opportunity to discuss it further with you after you see my work and resume.

To get started you will just need to run 

    ```
    yarn install
     yarn start
     ```
This project has two main components visible on the screen, the inning selector and the scoreboard. The inning selector lets you change between the two feeds provided. The scoreboard is configured to always show at least 9 innings and limit it to 12 innings to ensure a better user experience in a game that goes to extra innings. 12 is smaller than it would need to be but I've set it to that just to show it in use. 

The scoreboard and gameclock componenets are divided into general components that could be used for any sport and baseball sepcific components that implement the general components. The Team Card component for displaying team information can be used for any sport so there is no baseball specific component.
